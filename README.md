# Codename Engine Test Repository
## Why does it exist?
I'm currently testing GitHub stuff with Codename Engine, and this repo was made to test out updating features.
**All of the releases are fake and does not contains any builds**. These only are here for testing purposes.

## Why is this repository empty?
The main goal is to keep THIS repository empty. Only get information based on releases, nothing in the repository files.
